Module 6 Homework Challenge
### Original Code from M6_Starter_Code under Module 6 Challenge
#### 
#### I followed the examples in the activities directory, the class notes and the office hours questions by students. It's all my programming. 
#### I was late submitting this M6 challenge due to a delay in getting the New York Times API key. It took several attempts to procure the key through email. Even tried calling NY times customer support. They were not helpful. Finally got the key.
#### There was no issues in procuring the Movie database key. 
#### I found this Module 6 challenge a lot challenging.  
#### Used list comprehension method to retrieve the following in the movie "genre", "spoken_language" and "production_countries".
####
#### Including the final output csv file "final_nytr_tmbd.csv"

#### Thank You.
